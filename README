# Seesaw Backend

This is the backend for seesaw, an essay-oriented social platforms.
It is written mostly in python and uses a mariadb (or mysql) database for storage.

Seesaw sets out to change the format from 'comments' that take seconds to write into
more thought out responses. We also seek to provide balance in arguments and allow
both sides to shine through.
